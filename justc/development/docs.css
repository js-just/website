    '1. Click the "Initialize" button and wait until an alert appears saying "Initialized.", Accept it.' "\A    "
    '2. Type JUSTC code into the Monaco Editor window (if there is no Monaco Editor window, skip this step - you\'ll be prompted to enter the code)' "\A    "
    '3. Click "Execute" button to run the code. You can also click "Parse" button instead to run without executing, or "Parser" or "Lexer" to only run the parser or lexer.' "\A\A"

    'The basics of JUSTC language:' "\A    "
    '- Everything is "commands" or "expressions", separated by either comma (",") or semicolon (";") or even nothing (use what you want).' "\A    "
    '- The JUSTC code could be an object, an array, or a JSON object:' "\A        "
    '* Object: nothing special, but the code should end with ".".' "\A        "
    '* Array: works just like JSON array, the code should start with "[" and end with "]".' "\A        "
    '* JSON Object: the name says everything. the code should start with "{" and end with "}".' "\A    "
    '- Defining variables is simple: just type variable name, then "=" or "is" or "-" or ":" or nothing (whatever you want), then value.' "\A        "
    'And you can also declare variable type by adding ":" right after variable name and then a type name (number/string/link/binary/hex/octal/data/array/object/...).' "\A        "
    'Note: type declaration actually affects variable type or may throw error in some cases.' "\A    "
    '- There is also some other operators and keywords to define variables, like "isn\'t" and "!=". (and conditions! "isif", "then", "else", and more)' "\A    "
    '- Types:' "\A        "
    '* String: either single/double -quoted or single identifier that does not match name of any defined variable.' "\A        "
    '* Number: any numbers, there is no int or float or double - they all are numbers. Also, if not in Object/JSON Object/Array, you can use "," intead of ".": 0,123 = 0.123.' "\A        "
    '* Boolean: true or false.' "\A            "
    'true: "true", "yes", "y".' "\A            "
    'false: "false", "no", "n".' "\A        "
    '* Null: "null", "nil"' "\A        "
    '* Objects, Arrays: same with when the entire code is JSON object or array (use [] for arrays and {} for objects).' "\A        "
    '* Links: similar to strings but for URLs. put "<" and ">" instead of quotes (example: <https://just.js.org/>).' "\A    "
    '- You can also define variables by executing JavaScript or Luau:' "\A        "
    'To embed JavaScript, use "{{" (open) and "}}" (close).' "\A        "
    'To embed Luau, use "<<" (open) and ">>" (close).' "\A        "
    'Yes, it will work in node.js and browsers. Yes, that means you can make websites on Luau now.' "\A        "
    'Example: "luautest = <<return 67>>, jstest = {{console.log(\'hi\');}}."' "\A    "
    '- Some important commands:' "\A        "
    '* output everything - outputs every defined variable' "\A        "
    '* output specified - outputs defined variables from return command' "\A        "
    '* output disabled - nothing' "\A        "
    '* return [] - (after output specified) outputs every variable in array' "\A        "
    '* return [] as [] - (after output specified) outputs every variable in array but renames them to identifiers/strings/numbers in array after "as"' "\A        "
    '* allow JavaScript - allows JavaScript' "\A        "
    '* disallow JavaScript - disallows JavaScript' "\A        "
    '* allow Luau - allows Luau' "\A        "
    '* disallow Luau - disallows Luau' "\A    "
    '- Built-ins:' "\A        "
    '* value() - returns value of variable by name' "\A        "
